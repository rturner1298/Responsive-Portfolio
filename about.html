                <p>
                    I have 20+ years of experience as a software engineer, and team leader. I have worked as an application developer, Quality Assurance Engineer, QA/QC Manager, Test Automation Engineer/Architect.
                </p>
<p>
                    I'm a hands-on technical leader who has been involved in several projects building software products from the ground up and providing guidance and presentations to upper level management. I am passionate about software development as I have been involved in every aspect of the process. This has provided me a unique perspective and given me unique insights on how to design and build software that are better suited for testing using automation. This has led to various projects with significantly reduced issues of quality.
</p>
                    <p>
                    I'm always interested in becoming a better technology leader, and elegantly engineering software of a very high standard.
