                    I was born on the small island of Antigua in the British west Indies. I am the seventh of eight sons of my parents, and one of a total of 11 siblings. I lived in antigua until my late teens and then I immigrated to the United States where I have lived for most of my life. After coming to the United States, I had the distinct honour and priviledge to serve as a soldier in the United States Army. Because of my status as a consicious objector, I was limited to serving in the medical corp. I really enjoyed my time as a soldier in the United States Army. I feel that my service prepared me for everything that was to me in my life. I attended college on the GI bill. I currently work as a software test automation engineer and architect.

                    I currently live in Pennsylvania but I spend most of my time in New Jersey so that I can be close to my jobs which are typically located in manhattan. I decided to  undertake this course as a way to improve my skills as I hope to start an enterprise focused on creating elegant test automation services for businesses. Learning how modern applications are architected will allow me to design better automation solutions for my clients.

                <p>I am very active in the community and I assist in the preparation of lunch once a month for my church. At least once a year, I participate in or sponser a medical mission in the third world primarily focusing on Asia, The Pacific, Africa and Latin America. I would love to increse my participation in these activities as I find them to be very fulfilling.</p>
